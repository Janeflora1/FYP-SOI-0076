                    AI FORENSICS SUITE - QUICK TUTORIAL
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This is an AI-Powered Digital Forensics Analysis Suite that combines multiple
forensics tools with machine learning algorithms for evidence analysis.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

1. INSTALL REQUIREMENTS
   Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   This installs all necessary dependencies:
   - streamlit (web interface)
   - scikit-learn (ML algorithms)
   - pandas (data handling)
   - opencv-python (image analysis)
   - scapy (network analysis)
   - pillow (image processing)
   - matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (visualization)

2. START THE APPLICATION
   Run: streamlit run app.py
   
   This launches the web interface at http://localhost:8501

3. NAVIGATE THE APPLICATION
   The left sidebar has menu items for each tool:
   - Home: Overview and guides
   - Evidence Sorter: Categorize forensic files
   - Smart Log Scanner: Detect anomalies in logs
   - Image Analyzer: Analyze images for evidence
   - Regex Extractor: Extract patterns (IPs, emails, hashes)
   - Timeline Builder: Create forensic timelines
   - Network Anomaly: Detect network threats
   - ML Classifier: Classify security events
   - Memory Analyzer: Analyze memory dumps

USING EACH TOOL
---------------

EVIDENCE SORTER
  • Select a folder with evidence files
  • Click "Analyze Evidence" 
  • View categorized files by type
  • See high-priority suspicious files
  • Download results as JSON/CSV

SMART LOG SCANNER
  • Upload a log file (txt, csv, or json)
  • System uses ML (Isolation Forest) to detect anomalies
  • View normal vs suspicious entries
  • See anomaly scores and patterns

IMAGE ANALYZER
  • Upload image files (jpg, png, gif, etc)
  • Analyzes EXIF metadata
  • Detects text in images (OCR)
  • Extracts color information
  • Calculates file hash

REGEX EXTRACTOR
  • Paste or upload text data
  • Extracts: IPs, emails, URLs, domains, hashes, credit cards
  • View evidence by type
  • Download extracted data

TIMELINE BUILDER
  • Upload file system timeline
  • Uploads Windows Event Logs
  • Generates chronological timeline
  • Creates forensic report
  • Exports to CSV/JSON

NETWORK ANOMALY DETECTOR
  • Upload PCAP file (packet capture)
  • Detects suspicious connections
  • Identifies unusual traffic patterns
  • Shows connection statistics

ML CLASSIFIER
  • Analyzes security logs
  • Classifies events as:
    - Normal operations
    - Brute force attempts
    - Privilege escalation
    - Malware execution
    - Data exfiltration
    - Lateral movement
    - Reconnaissance

MEMORY ANALYZER
  • Analyzes memory dumps
  • Detects injected code
  • Finds suspicious processes
  • Identifies malware signatures

KEY FEATURES
-----------
✓ AI-powered anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
✓ ML-based log classification (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting)
✓ Pattern-based evidence extraction with regex
✓ Image forensics with metadata analysis
✓ Network traffic anomaly detection
✓ Automated timeline correlation
✓ Export results in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)
✓ Real-time threat analysis
✓ Comprehensive reporting

ALGORITHMS USED
---------------
1. Isolation Forest - Anomaly detection in logs
2. Random Forest - Log classification
3. Gradient Boosting - Event prediction
4. TF-IDF Vectorization - Text feature extraction
5. StandardScaler - Feature normalization

OUTPUT FORMATS
--------------
All tools can export results in:
- JSON (structured data)
- CSV (spreadsheet format)
- PDF (formatted reports)
- TXT (plain text summaries)

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Q: App won't start
A: Make sure all requirements are installed: pip install -r requirements.txt

Q: File upload not working
A: Check file format - only specific formats are supported per tool

Q: Slow processing
A: Large files may take time. Progress indicators show status.

Q: No results
A: Try with sample data first to verify the tool works

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
------------------
In Streamlit interface:
- 'R' to rerun the app
- 'C' to clear cache
- 'K' to toggle menu

GETTING HELP
-----------
Each tool has an info box with:
- Purpose and description
- Supported file formats
- Expected output
- Example use cases

NEXT STEPS
---------
1. Run: streamlit run app.py
2. Explore the Home tab for overview
3. Try each tool with sample data
4. Upload your forensic evidence
5. Analyze results and export reports
6. Use timeline builder to correlate events
