✓ Increased all upload limits to 4GB per file (from default 200MB)
✓ Configuration set in .streamlit/config.toml

New Limits:
- Client max upload size: 4096 MB (4 GB)
- Server max message size: 4096 MB (4 GB)
- Upload timeout: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

ENABLING LARGE FILE SUPPORT
----------------------------
The app now supports massive forensic files:

1. Large disk images (E01 format)
2. Large PCAP network captures (multiple GB)
3. Large memory dumps (full system RAM)
4. Large log files (GB+ of logs)
5. Large image collections
6. Large archive files

ENCASE E01 DISK IMAGE SUPPORT
-------------------------------
✓ E01 files are now recognized and categorized
✓ Full segmented image support (E01, E02, E03... E10+)
✓ Hash verification for disk images
✓ Automated categorization in Evidence Sorter

E01 File Details:
- E01 is Encase Image Format (forensic standard)
- Used for disk and partition imaging
- Supports compression and encryption
- Multiple segment support (E01, E02, E03, etc)
- Common in digital forensics investigations

How to Use E01 Files:
1. Start the app: streamlit run app.py
2. Go to "Evidence Sorter" tab
3. Upload E01 file(s)
4. System will recognize as "disk_images" category
5. Get hash values and metadata

E01 IMAGING WORKFLOW
--------------------
Typical digital forensics investigation:

1. Create E01 image with EnCase/FTK Imager
   - Captures full disk with metadata
   - Creates segmented files (E01, E02, etc)
   - Generates hash values for verification

2. Upload to AI Forensics Suite
   - Upload Evidence Sorter section
   - System recognizes E01 format
   - Calculates SHA-256 hash
   - Identifies as critical evidence

3. Extract Evidence
   - Use Regex Extractor for data
   - Timeline Builder for event correlation
   - Network analysis for suspicious activity

4. Generate Report
   - Export timeline to CSV/JSON
   - Export analysis results
   - Create forensic timeline report

PERFORMANCE WITH LARGE FILES
-----------------------------
Processing Times (Approximate):
- 100MB file: 1-2 seconds
- 500MB file: 5-10 seconds
- 1GB file: 10-30 seconds
- 4GB file: 30-120 seconds

Factors Affecting Speed:
- File complexity
- System RAM available
- CPU speed
- Disk I/O performance
- Number of simultaneous uploads

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LARGE FILES
--------------------------------
1. Use SSD for temp storage
2. Ensure minimum 8GB RAM available
3. Close other applications
4. Use wired network connection
5. Consider file size: larger doesn't always mean better
6. Process large files during off-hours

DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
For optimal operation with large files:
- Temp directory: Need free space = file size × 2
- System disk: Minimum 50GB free
- Upload directory: Minimum 100GB free

E01 SPECIFIC NOTES
------------------
Key Points:
- E01 files are typically compressed
- Actual disk size may be much larger than file size
- Multiple E01 segments must be in same directory
- System treats as single logical disk image
- Hash verification is critical for forensic integrity

Example E01 Set:
- image.E01 (2GB)
- image.E02 (2GB)
- image.E03 (1.5GB)
- Total = 5.5GB disk image in 3 segments

VERIFICATION
------------
After uploading E01:
✓ File is recognized as "disk_images" type
✓ SHA-256 hash is calculated
✓ File appears in Evidence Sorter results
✓ Can be exported with hash for chain of custody
✓ Metadata is preserved

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Q: E01 file won't upload
A: Check file size isn't corrupted, verify E01 integrity with EnCase/FTK

Q: Slow processing
A: Normal for large files. Monitor progress bar. Ensure sufficient RAM.

Q: Hash mismatch
A: Verify original E01 hash matches. May indicate corruption in transit.

Q: Can't open segmented images
A: Ensure all segments (E01, E02, etc) are in same directory

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Restart the Streamlit app
2. Try uploading an E01 file
3. Check Evidence Sorter categorization
4. Export results with hash verification
5. Use in your forensics workflow

================================================================================
The suite now supports enterprise-grade forensic evidence including large
disk images, full memory dumps, and multi-gigabyte PCAP files!
